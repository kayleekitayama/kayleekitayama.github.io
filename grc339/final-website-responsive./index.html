                  <h3>Top story: vegan avocado oat milk to hit US stores in August</h3>
                  <p>
                     Next month, non-dairy milk brand Avocadomilk will debut a new vegan version of its avocado-based milk in the United States. Made with oats and freeze-dried avocado, the milk is created with a patented technology that maintains the nutritional integrity of the avocado fruit, and also makes use of the “ugly” avocados that do not make it to grocery stores and would otherwise be discarded.
