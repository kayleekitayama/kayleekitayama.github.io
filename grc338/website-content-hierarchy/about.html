         <p>Z's Bakery is a flourishing gluten free and vegan baking business that was started from the ground up by its current owner, Annika Kitayama. Annika creates a plethora of innovative pastries and desserts featuring fresh, seasonal, local and wholesome ingredients that are entirely gluten free and vegan. Her creative vision and plans began years ago as a child, as she learned to bake with her mother, Rebecca. Annika's mother taught her all about traditional baking and from both parents, she learned how to express love through creation and nourishment. It quickly became clear that sweet treats, creative expression, acts of service and nurturing others were part of her foundation and what she needed to do to thrive.</p>
